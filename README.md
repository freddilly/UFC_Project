# UFC_Project

## Presentation
Selected Topic: To analyze historical UFC fight data, in order to create a machine learning algorithm that can accurately predict the result of an upcoming fight with the proper inputs.

Reason for Selecting Topic: I selected this topic for two main reasons. The first is that I am a big UFC fan, so this project appeals to my interests. The second reason is that UFC bouts are seen as being very hard to predict, so I want to see if it is at all possible to predict these fights accurately

Data Source: My data source is a kaggle dataset that details every UFC fight from 1999 to 2019. (https://www.kaggle.com/rajeevw/ufcdata)

Question hoping to answer: The main question I am hoping to answer is whether or not UFC fights are in fact predictable over the long run. I also want to determine what are the main predictors for a UFC fight.
